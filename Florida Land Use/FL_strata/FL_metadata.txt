  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National
      Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) area sampling frame is a
      delineation of all parcels of land for the purpose of later sampling the
      parcels.  The area frame is constructed by visually interpreting satellite
      imagery to divide a state into homogenous land use areas (strata) based
      on percent cultivated.  The strata are typically defined as low, medium or
      high percent cultivated, non-agricultural land, urban use, agri-urban, or
      water.  The boundaries of the strata usually follow identifiable features
      such as roads, railroads and waterways.  The strata boundaries do not
      coincide with any political boundaries, with the exception of state
      boundaries.

      Though all of the dates for this frame point to 2004, this is only when the
      older frame from the paper map was converted over to digital form. All of the
      stratification work for the paper maps and was completed in 1990.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state
      level.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at a scale of
      1:100,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:250,000, etc.).  The strata data are
      provided "as is".  USDA/NASS does not warrant results you may obtain
      using the strata data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The area sampling frame for Florida was constructed for use in 2010
        and was based on USGS 1:24,000 and 1:100,000 scale topographic maps,
        1:250,000 scale Landsat imagery, and 2 meter resolution NAIP imagery.
        Individual county files were merged into single statefile. The coordinates
        for the strata polygons are unprojected to geographic latitude and longitude
        (decimal degrees).  The spatial data file format is Environmental Systems
        Research Institute's ArcView shapefile format. Gaps and overlaps were corrected
        within and ESRI personal geodatabase.
